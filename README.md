### DONE

- Array List
  - array\_list/array\_list.h
- Linked List
  - linked\_list/linked\_list.h
- Logger
  - logger/logger.h
  - Note:
    - The testing is lacking kind of, I don't really know how should I test it well.
    - Perhaps by using it I will find some weaknesses
- String
  - string/string.h
  - Note:
    - I will probably have to rename it
- Hasher
  - hash/hash.h

### Needing tests

- Hash Table
  - hash\_map/hash\_map.h

### In implementation

### Ideas

- Binary Tree
  - binary\_tree/binary\_tree.h
- Arena
  - arena.h
  - maybe?
- StringBuilder
  - string\_builder.h
  - Basically it is a Linked List of char arrays.
- Graph
  - graph.h
