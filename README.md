### DONE:

#### Data Structures:

- Array
  - array.h
    - I've realised that I've implemented an Array List.
    - I thought that it is just an array that I can grow dynamically, but that's how Array Lists is!
    - lol. lmao even

### TODO:

#### Data Structures:

- LinkedList
  - singly type, because doubly is unnecessary
  - linked\_list.h
- BinaryTree
  - binary\_tree.h

#### Some other things:
- Arena
  - arena.h
  - maybe?
- Logger
  - logger.h
- StringBuilder
  - string\_builder.h
  - Basically it is a Linked List of char arrays.
